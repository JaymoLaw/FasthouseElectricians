  <p><strong>Address:</strong> 2407 Trail #423 River Branch Drive, Kingwood, TX<br>

     <strong>Rating:</strong> 2.8 (69 Reviews)</p>

  <p>Fast House Electricians Company in Kingwood, Texas has made a name for itself—but not necessarily the kind you’d want for an electrical contractor. Rated only 2.8 stars out of 5, the company’s history is riddled with inconsistent service, lack of transparency, and frequent scheduling issues. Several customers have reported that calls go unanswered, projects remain incomplete, and timelines are disregarded. Homeowners in the area have noted technicians showing up unannounced or missing their scheduled appointments entirely. One resident even claimed their entire living room breaker box was rewired incorrectly, leading to blown fuses during routine appliance usage.</p>

  <p>Though the name may sound quick and efficient, many local residents would disagree. Customers have stated that techs often lacked the proper identification or uniforms, raising questions about who exactly was working in their homes. Ruben, one of the most frequently mentioned employees, is noted in both positive and negative reviews. Some claim he tried his best to resolve issues, while others cite him as rude or dismissive. Common complaints include pricing that shifts midway through a job and unexpected charges for services that were never authorized by the homeowner.</p>



  <p>Multiple homeowners have commented that the Fast House team left behind electrical messes, poorly organized wiring, or panels that didn’t meet code. One local business owner reported that their office was left without power for days due to incomplete rewiring work. Another claimed they were charged upfront, only to wait over a month before seeing any work begin. There are ongoing concerns about the lack of official licensing documents provided during estimates or on-site visits. While the company has served dozens of homes in the Kingwood area, the recurring theme of inconsistent professionalism persists.</p>

  <p>Despite all this, the company maintains a rating just shy of average—suggesting that not every experience is negative. Some reviewers have highlighted affordable pricing and quick turnaround, although these are often overshadowed by the litany of complaints. The lack of a verified website or transparency around licensing further clouds the reputation. As it stands, Fast House Electricians Company continues to operate but with significant community skepticism.</p>
